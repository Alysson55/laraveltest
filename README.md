# laraveltest

PS: I couldn't install the json so due to the test time limit which is 60 minutes,
I'm going to leave the tabs there pretending they are Routes, Controllers and Wiew just simulating

The code will not run due to the test limit of 60 minutes but I left it as if it were within the possible and what I managed to do the intention is to show that I made the effort and tried and not simply gave up of course due to the time limitation I could not install the json.

First I simulated how the routes were created for the basic display, there are no routes, just put localhost and ok

To delete it, I put it in the simulation I made /delete even without executing it, take into account that it is just a simulation and lastly I created the controller just for the purpose of testing where you place the classes and extensions
I am very grateful for the opportunities of this test I was very wrong for sure but I was the one who did it alone without external help based on courses and classes that I have already taken before and I did not go to college everything I learned on my own in a self-taught way
Thank you all
